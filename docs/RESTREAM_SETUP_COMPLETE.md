# ✅ Restream.io Live Stream Setup - COMPLETE

## 🎥 Stream Configuration

Your Restream.io live stream is now configured and ready to display on your frontend game page!

### Stream Details
- **RTMP URL**: `rtmp://live.restream.io/live`
- **Stream Key**: `re_10541509_eventd4960ba1734c49369fc0d114295801a0`
- **Player URL**: `https://player.restream.io?token=re_10541509_eventd4960ba1734c49369fc0d114295801a0`

## 📺 How It Works

### Frontend Display
1. **Player Game Page** (`/game` or `/`)
   - The `VideoStream` component automatically loads your Restream credentials
   - Uses Restream's player iframe: `https://player.restream.io?token=YOUR_STREAM_KEY`
   - Stream appears in the video area with game overlays (timer, round info, etc.)

2. **Auto-Configuration**
   - Settings are pre-filled in the `SimpleStreamSettings` component
   - Credentials are auto-saved to the database on first load
   - No manual configuration needed!

### Backend Settings Page
- Visit `/backend-settings` to view/manage stream settings
- Stream preview shows live when streaming
- Copy RTMP URL and Stream Key for OBS setup

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`client/src/components/AdminGamePanel/SimpleStreamSettings.tsx`**
   - Pre-filled with your Restream credentials
   - Auto-saves settings on component mount
   - Status set to 'live' by default

2. **`client/src/components/VideoStream.tsx`**
   - Loads stream settings from backend API
   - Displays Restream player iframe when stream key is configured
   - Shows placeholder when stream is offline

3. **`client/src/components/MobileGameLayout/VideoArea.tsx`**
   - Integrates VideoStream component
   - Adds game overlays (timer, round info, etc.)

### Database Configuration
- Stream settings stored in `stream_settings` table
- Settings keys:
  - `restream_rtmp_url`: RTMP server URL
  - `restream_stream_key`: Your unique stream key
  - `stream_title`: Display title
  - `stream_status`: 'live' or 'offline'
