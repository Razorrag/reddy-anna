# 🎯 Round 2 Auto-Transition Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Round 2 wasn't starting automatically after Round 1 ended with no winner.

## Root Cause
Pre-selected cards were being cleared **immediately after dealing**, so when Round 2 started, there were no cards to reveal.

## The Fix (Applied)

### Changed in `server/routes.ts`:
**Only clear pre-selected cards when:**
1. Game ends (winner found)
2. Before transitioning to next round

### Lines Modified:
- **Lines 415-443**: Round 1 auto-reveal logic
- **Lines 1324-1352**: Round 2 auto-reveal logic

---

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow:
```
Round 1:
1. Admin selects opening card → Start Round 1
2. 30s betting timer → Admin pre-selects cards
3. Timer expires → Cards auto-reveal
4. No winner? → Clear cards → Wait 2s → Auto-start Round 2 ✅

Round 2:
5. Betting timer starts (30s) automatically ✅
6. Admin pre-selects NEW cards for Round 2
7. Timer expires → Cards auto-reveal
8. No winner? → Clear cards → Wait 2s → Auto-start Round 3 ✅

Round 3:
9. Continuous draw (no timer)
10. Admin deals manually until match
11. Winner found → Game complete
```

## What Changed

### Before:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Always cleared cards
if (baharWinner) {
  await completeGame('bahar', baharDisplay);
} else if (andarWinner) {
  await completeGame('andar', andarDisplay);
} else {
  setTimeout(() => transitionToRound2(), 2000);
}
// Cards cleared here - too late!
currentGameState.preSelectedBaharCard = null;
currentGameState.preSelectedAndarCard = null;
```

### After:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Clear at right time
if (baharWinner) {
  await completeGame('bahar', baharDisplay);
  // Clear after game ends
  currentGameState.preSelectedBaharCard = null;
  currentGameState.preSelectedAndarCard = null;
} else if (andarWinner) {
  await completeGame('andar', andarDisplay);
  // Clear after game ends
  currentGameState.preSelectedBaharCard = null;
  currentGameState.preSelectedAndarCard = null;
} else {
  // Clear BEFORE transitioning
  currentGameState.preSelectedBaharCard = null;
  currentGameState.preSelectedAndarCard = null;
  setTimeout(() => transitionToRound2(), 2000);
}
```
