# Streaming and Game State Persistence Fixes

## Overview
Fixed critical issues where web streaming would stop when the game timer started, and game state (cards, bets, timer) would not persist after page refresh.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stream Stops When Timer Starts
**Problem**: When the betting timer started, the video stream would freeze, lag, or disconnect completely.

**Root Cause**: The `VideoArea` component was using `useGameState()` hook, causing it to re-render every second when the timer updated. This caused the video element to unmount/remount, disrupting the WebRTC connection.

**Solution**:
- **Separated Timer from Video**: Created independent `TimerOverlay` component that updates independently of video stream
- **Isolated VideoArea**: Removed `useGameState()` from `VideoArea` component to prevent re-renders
- **Memoization**: Enhanced React.memo() comparison to only re-render when `isScreenSharing` prop changes
- **Stable Keys**: Added stable keys to WebRTC and RTMP players to prevent unnecessary remounting

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/MobileGameLayout/VideoArea.tsx`
- `client/src/components/StreamPlayer.tsx`
- `client/src/components/StreamPlayer/WebRTCPlayer.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Stream State Not Restored After Refresh
**Problem**: When players refreshed the page, the stream would not reconnect even if admin was still streaming.

**Root Cause**: Game state synchronization didn't include active streaming status, so players didn't know a stream was active.

**Solution**:
- **Server-Side**: Added `isScreenSharingActive` flag to game state sync
- **Backend Check**: Query WebRTC signaling server for active streams in `getCurrentGameStateForUser()`
- **Frontend Restore**: WebSocketContext now sets screen sharing state on authentication
- **Persistent State**: Streaming status maintained through game state updates

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes.ts` - Added streaming status to game state
- `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` - Restore streaming state on auth
- `server/socket/game-handlers.ts` - Added helper to check streaming status

### 3. ✅ Timer and Stream Independence
**Problem**: Timer broadcasts interfering with video stream stability.

**Solution**:
- **Component Isolation**: Timer overlay in separate component that doesn't affect video layer
- **Render Optimization**: Video stream container never re-renders due to timer updates
- **Layer Separation**: Timer overlay positioned absolutely above video, no parent re-renders

**Architecture**:
```
VideoArea (stable, only re-renders when isScreenSharing changes)
  ├─ StreamPlayer (memoized, stable key)
  │   └─ WebRTCPlayer (single initialization, no reconnects)
  └─ TimerOverlay (separate component, updates independently)
```

### 4. ✅ Game State Persistence After Refresh
**Problem**: Cards, bets, and timer would vanish when player refreshed the page.

**Solution**: Already implemented correctly - verified working
- User bets fetched from database on reconnect
- Cards (opening, andar, bahar) included in game state sync
- Timer value synchronized from server
- All state properly restored via `getCurrentGameStateForUser()`

**Files Verified**:
- `server/routes.ts` - Game state includes all necessary data
- `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` - Properly applies synced state

## Technical Implementation Details

### VideoArea Component Architecture
```typescript
// OLD (PROBLEMATIC):
const VideoArea = () => {
  const { gameState } = useGameState(); // Re-renders every second!
  const timer = gameState.countdownTimer;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <StreamPlayer /> {/* Gets unmounted on every timer update */}
      <TimerDisplay timer={timer} />
    </div>
  );
};

// NEW (FIXED):
const TimerOverlay = React.memo(() => {
  const { gameState } = useGameState(); // Only this component updates
  return <TimerDisplay />; // Separate layer, no parent re-render
});

const VideoArea = React.memo(({ isScreenSharing }) => {
  // NO useGameState here!
  return (
    <div>
      <StreamPlayer isScreenSharing={isScreenSharing} /> {/* Stable! */}
      <TimerOverlay /> {/* Updates independently */}
    </div>
  );
}, (prev, next) => prev.isScreenSharing === next.isScreenSharing);
```

### Streaming State Persistence
```typescript
// Server: getCurrentGameStateForUser()
const activeStreams = webrtcSignaling.getActiveStreams();
const isScreenSharingActive = activeStreams.length > 0;

const gameStateForUser = {
  // ... other game state
  isScreenSharingActive: isScreenSharingActive, // ← CRITICAL FIX
  activeStreams: activeStreams
};

// Client: WebSocketContext
case 'authenticated':
  const { isScreenSharingActive } = gameState;
  if (isScreenSharingActive !== undefined) {
    setScreenSharing(isScreenSharingActive); // ← Restore stream state
  }
```

### WebRTC Connection Stability
```typescript
// Prevent multiple initializations
const isInitializedRef = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isInitializedRef.current) {
    return; // Skip re-initialization
  }
  isInitializedRef.current = true;
  initializeWebRTC();
  
  return () => {
    isInitializedRef.current = false; // Reset on unmount
    cleanup();
  };
}, [roomId]);
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Stream Stability During Game**
- [x] Stream continues smoothly when betting timer starts
- [x] Stream stays connected during card dealing
- [x] Stream maintains connection during round transitions
- [x] No video freezing or disconnections

✅ **Page Refresh Persistence**
- [x] Stream reconnects automatically after refresh (if admin still streaming)
- [x] Opening card visible after refresh
- [x] Dealt cards (Andar/Bahar) persist after refresh
- [x] Player bets display correctly after refresh
- [x] Timer shows correct value after refresh

✅ **Timer Independence**
- [x] Timer updates every second without affecting video
- [x] Timer transitions between rounds smoothly
- [x] Video quality remains consistent during timer updates

✅ **Multi-Player Scenarios**
- [x] All players see stream simultaneously
- [x] New players joining see active stream
- [x] Stream doesn't drop when players join/leave
- [x] Bets from all players displayed correctly

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- VideoArea re-renders: **60 times per minute** (every timer tick)
- Video element remounts: **60 times per minute**
- WebRTC reconnections: **Multiple per game**
- Player refresh: **Lost all game state**

### After Fixes:
- VideoArea re-renders: **Only on stream state change** (~2-3 per game)
- Video element remounts: **Never** (except intentional stream switch)
- WebRTC reconnections: **Zero** (unless network issues)
- Player refresh: **Full state restored** (cards, bets, timer, stream)

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Tested and working in:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari (with autoplay restrictions handled)
- Mobile browsers

**Note**: Autoplay warning in console is normal browser behavior and doesn't affect functionality.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Separate Concerns**: Timer overlay should never affect video rendering
2. **Memo Wisely**: Use React.memo with custom comparison for expensive components
3. **Stable Keys**: Prevent unnecessary remounting of video players
4. **Single Source**: Server maintains streaming state, clients sync from it
5. **Ref Guards**: Prevent multiple WebRTC initializations

---

## Monitoring

### Console Logs to Watch:
```
✅ "VideoArea: isScreenSharing = true"  // Stream state change
✅ "WebRTC Player: Already initialized"  // Preventing duplicate init
✅ "Restoring stream state: true"        // State restored after refresh
✅ "WebRTC connection established!"      // Successful connection
```

### Warning Messages (Normal):
```
⚠️ "Video autoplay prevented"  // Browser autoplay policy (expected)
```

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Reconnection Logic**: Add exponential backoff for failed WebRTC connections
2. **Quality Adaptation**: Adjust stream quality based on network conditions
3. **Viewer Count**: Display live viewer count in admin panel
4. **Stream Analytics**: Track stream uptime and connection quality metrics
5. **Fallback Streaming**: Auto-fallback to RTMP if WebRTC fails

## Deployment Notes

No breaking changes. All fixes are backward compatible.

**Restart Required**: Yes, both client and server
**Database Changes**: None
**API Changes**: None (enhanced existing responses)

## Support

If stream issues persist:
1. Check browser console for WebRTC errors
2. Verify admin has started screen sharing
3. Ensure WebSocket connection is stable
4. Check network connectivity for WebRTC (STUN/TURN)
