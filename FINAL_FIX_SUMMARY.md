## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Architecture Principles

1. **Role-Based UI Separation**
   - Admin needs continuous control
   - Players need visual feedback
   - Never mix role-specific components

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Hardcoded values should be environment variables
   - Makes deployment flexible
   - Easier to tune for different environments

3. **Security First**
   - No authentication bypasses
   - Always validate tokens
   - Never trust client-side role claims

4. **Documentation**
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Add warnings for common mistakes
   - Maintain fix logs
