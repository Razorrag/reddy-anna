## 🚨 Critical Security Features

### Server-Side Validation
All role checks happen on server - frontend cannot bypass

### JWT Token Verification
WebSocket validates tokens before accepting role claims

### Role Spoofing Prevention
Cannot claim admin role without valid JWT token

### Audit Logging
All unauthorized attempts are logged:
```
⚠️ Admin attempted to place bet - blocked
⚠️ Non-admin attempted to start game - blocked
⚠️ Non-admin attempted to deal card - blocked
```

### Session Security
- HttpOnly cookies
- SameSite: lax
- Session timeout: 24 hours
- Secure flag (when HTTPS enabled)

---

## 📊 Performance & Scalability
