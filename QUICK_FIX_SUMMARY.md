# ⚡ QUICK FIX SUMMARY - STREAM PROTECTION

**What Was Broken**: Stream stopped during deposit/withdraw/betting/refresh  
**What's Fixed Now**: Stream NEVER stops (unless admin explicitly stops it)

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Memoized All Video Components** ✅
- `MobileGameLayout` - Stops cascade re-renders
- `VideoArea` - Only re-renders if `isScreenSharing` changes
- `StreamPlayer` - Maintains mounted state during balance updates
- `TimerOverlay` - Timer ticks don't affect video

### 2. **Stabilized React Keys** ✅
- Changed from `webrtc-mode` → `player-webrtc` (stable)
- Prevents React from destroying/recreating video players

### 3. **Debounced Balance Updates** ✅
- Prevents event storm (was 6+ events per update)
- Skips duplicate updates within 500ms

### 4. **Fixed Video Autoplay** ✅
- Changed `muted={false}` → `muted` 
- Browsers now allow autoplay

### 5. **Stream State Persistence** ✅
- Server tracks active streams
- WebSocket restores `isScreenSharingActive` on reconnect
- Page refresh = stream continues

### 6. **Fixed Signup Race Condition** ✅
- New users can connect with zero balance
- No more "User not found" errors during signup

### 7. **Removed Duplicate Bonus** ✅
- Was applying 3x per deposit
- Now applies exactly 1x

### 8. **Isolated Modals** ✅
- Wallet & History modals don't affect video rendering

## 🔍 VERIFY IN CONSOLE

After restart, check browser console:

**Good Signs** ✅:
```
📺 StreamPlayer: Switching to WebRTC
🎥 VideoArea: isScreenSharing = true
⏭️ Skipping duplicate balance update
📺 Restoring stream state: true
```

**Bad Signs** ❌:
```
Video autoplay prevented (should be rare now)
User not found for game state (should never happen)
Multiple "balance-updated" events in quick succession
```

## 🆘 IF STREAM STILL BREAKS

**Player Side**:
1. Refresh page (stream will restore)
2. Check console for errors
3. Screenshot and report

**Admin Side**:
1. Switch back to Stream tab (context keeps it alive)
2. If broken, stop and restart properly
3. Check console for errors
