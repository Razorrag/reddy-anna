# Round 3 Manual Card Dealing - Quick Guide

## TL;DR
Admin now has full control over card reveals in Round 3. Select card → Click "Show Card" → Card appears to players → Repeat until match found.

## How It Works

### Admin Side (Round 3)

**1. Select Card**
- Click any card from the grid
- Card highlights with gold border
- Shows: "Selected for BAHAR" (or ANDAR)

**2. Show Card**
- Click **"🎬 Show Card to BAHAR"** button
- Card instantly appears on all player screens
- System automatically switches to next side

**3. Repeat**
- System alternates: Bahar → Andar → Bahar → Andar...
- Continue until matching card found
- Game completes automatically

### Visual Example

```
Step 1: Admin clicks K♠
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Selected for BAHAR  │
│        K♠           │
└─────────────────────┘

Step 2: Admin clicks "Show Card to BAHAR"
→ K♠ appears on player screens under BAHAR

Step 3: Button changes to "Show Card to ANDAR"
→ Admin selects next card and repeats
```

## Key Features

✅ **Manual Control** - Admin decides when cards appear  
✅ **Automatic Alternation** - System switches Bahar ↔ Andar  
✅ **Instant Winner** - Game ends when match found

## Workflow

```
Round 3 Starts
    ↓
Admin: Select Card
    ↓
Admin: Click "Show Card"
    ↓
Card appears to players
    ↓
Match found? 
    ├─ NO → Repeat (alternate side)
    └─ YES → Game Complete
            ↓
        Payouts Credited
            ↓
        Game Resets
```

## Payout (Round 3)

**Both sides pay 1:1 on total bets:**
- Total bets = Round 1 + Round 2
- Payout = Total × 2 (1:1 ratio)

**Example:**
- Player bet ₹10K (R1) + ₹20K (R2) = ₹30K total
- If player's side wins: ₹30K × 2 = ₹60K payout

## Testing

1. Play through Rounds 1 & 2 (no winners)
2. Round 3 starts automatically
3. Admin sees new interface with "Show Card" button
4. Select cards and click "Show Card" repeatedly
5. When match found, game completes
6. Verify payouts and reset
