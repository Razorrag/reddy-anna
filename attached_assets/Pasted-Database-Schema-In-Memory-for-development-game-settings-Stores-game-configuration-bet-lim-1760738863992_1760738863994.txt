  Game Logic

  Card Dealing Algorithm:
   1. Cards alternate between Andar and Bahar sides starting with Bahar (position 1 = Bahar, position 2 = Andar, etc.)
   2. Dealing continues until a card with the same rank as the opening card appears
   3. The side where the matching card appears wins the round

  Betting System:
   1. Players can place bets during the betting phase
   2. Bet amounts must be within configured minimum (₹1,000) and maximum (₹50,000) limits
   3. Bets are recorded with user ID, game ID, round, side, and amount
   4. Betting closes when timer reaches zero

  Win Calculation:
   1. Payout is 1:1 for winning bets
   2. All losing bets go to the house (except commissions which may be implemented later)
   3. Game history tracks winning patterns for analytics

  Frontend Technologies:

  Player Interface:
   - HTML5: Semantic structure with video stream support
   - CSS3: Responsive design with Flexbox, Grid, and animations

  Admin Interface:
   - HTML5: Card grid interface and modal-based settings
   - CSS3: Themed interface with gradients and shadows
   - JavaScript: Game control logic and state management
   - WebSocket: Broadcasting to player clients

  Database Schema:

  Tables:
   - game_settings: setting_key, setting_value, updated_at
   - game_sessions: game_id, opening_card, phase, current_timer, status, winner, winning_card, created_at, updated_at
   - dealt_cards: id, game_id, card, side, position, is_winning_card, created_at

   - API Base URL: Configurable via config.js (development: http://localhost:4000, production: external endpoint)
   - WebSocket URL: Derived from API base URL (http → ws protocol)
   - Video Streams: Support for local files, remote URLs, embedded URLs, and RTMP streams

  Backend:

   7. Implement WebSocket connections on both frontend interfaces
   8. Add game state synchronization logic
   9. Test real-time functionality between admin and player
   10. Ensure mobile responsiveness matches original design
   11. Add proper error handling and fallbacks

  Database Migration Ready:
   - Structure should be ready for Supabase migration using the @supabase/supabase-js client
   - Connection strings configurable via environment variables
   - Schema should match the existing in-memory structure for easy transition

  Special Considerations:
   - Ensure the exact same visual design and layout as original
   - Maintain all frontend functionality including animations and transitions
   - Implement proper authentication system (even if simplified for demo)
   - Include proper error handling and notifications
   - Ensure all real-time features work with multiple connected clients
   - Make sure mobile responsiveness is pixel-perfect with original
   - Use the same font family (Poppins) and color scheme (gold/black theme)

  Please implement the entire application with all functionality matching the original Reddy Anna Kossu Andar Bahar game, including the exact same
  user interfaces, game logic, and real-time synchronization between admin and players.
