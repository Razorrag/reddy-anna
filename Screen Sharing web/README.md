## File Structure

```
screen-sharing-web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles and responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript functionality and WebRTC
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sw.js              # Service worker (optional)
```

## Customization

### Changing Video Quality
Edit the `getDisplayMedia` constraints in `script.js`:

```javascript
video: {
    width: { ideal: 1920 },    // Change resolution
    height: { ideal: 1080 },
    frameRate: { ideal: 30 }   // Change frame rate
}
```

### Styling
Modify `styles.css` to customize:
- Colors and gradients
- Button styles
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions

### Adding Features
The modular JavaScript structure makes it easy to add:
- Chat functionality
- Recording capabilities
- Multiple viewer management
- Custom controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Screen sharing was denied"**
- Make sure to click "Allow" when the browser asks for permission
- Check if another application is already using screen sharing

**"Screen sharing is not supported"**
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for best compatibility

**"No audio in screen share"**
- Make sure to check "Share audio" when starting screen share
- Some browsers require HTTPS for audio sharing

**Poor video quality**
- Check your internet connection
- Close other applications using bandwidth
- Try reducing the video quality in the code

### Browser-Specific Notes

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Best support for all features
- Requires HTTPS for audio sharing in production

**Firefox:**
- Good support for screen sharing
- May have different UI for permission dialogs

**Safari:**
- Basic screen sharing support
- Limited audio sharing options

## Security Considerations

- Screen sharing requires explicit user permission
- No data is stored or transmitted to external servers
- All communication happens locally in the browser
- Use HTTPS in production for enhanced security

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Multi-user screen sharing
- Chat and messaging
- Screen recording
- Mobile app versions
- Server-side relay for better connectivity
- User authentication
- Meeting rooms and scheduling
