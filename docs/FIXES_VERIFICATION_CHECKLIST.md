## How to Use This Checklist

1. Start the application (backend + frontend)
2. Open admin panel in one browser
3. Open 2-3 player panels in other browsers
4. Follow each test scenario below
5. Check off each item as you verify it works

---

## ✅ Issue #1: Import Path Errors

### Test Steps:
1. [ ] Navigate to admin game page
2. [ ] Verify GameAdmin component loads without errors
3. [ ] Check browser console for import errors
4. [ ] Verify BettingStats component displays correctly

### Expected Result:
- No "Module not found" errors
- GameAdmin renders properly
- BettingStats shows bet totals

### Verification:
```bash
# Check the files were fixed:
cat client/src/components/GameAdmin/index.ts
# Should show: export { default } from './GameAdmin';

cat client/src/components/BettingStats/BettingStats.tsx
# Should use: gameState.round1Bets and gameState.round2Bets
```

---

## ✅ Issue #2: Architecture Consolidation

### Test Steps:
1. [ ] Start backend server
2. [ ] Check server logs for GameLoopService usage
3. [ ] Verify all game actions go through routes.ts
4. [ ] Place a bet and check which file handles it

### Expected Result:

- All WebSocket messages handled by routes.ts
- Single game state object

### Verification:
```bash

grep -r "gameLoopService" server/
# Should only find in deprecated file
```

console.log(gameState.phase);        // Should be: 'betting', 'dealing', etc.
console.log(gameState.currentRound); // Should be: 1, 2, or 3
