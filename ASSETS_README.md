## Card Images (Optional)

## Creating Placeholder Assets

To create simple placeholder images, you can use an image editor or online tools to create:

1. **Coin Images**: Create circular images with appropriate values (₹2.5k, ₹5k, etc.) and save them with the correct filenames in the coins directory.

2. **Video File**: You can use any video file for testing purposes and rename it to `uhd_30fps.mp4`.

## Note
If the coin images are not present, the application will display fallback text instead of images.
