# 🎥 Video Overlay Text Cleanup

## ✅ What Was Removed

### **VideoArea.tsx** (Lines 83-93)

**Removed Text Overlays:**
- ❌ "Live Stream" text
- ❌ "Game ID: [id]" text  
- ❌ "Waiting for game to start..." text

**Before:**
```tsx
{gameState.phase === 'idle' && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/50 pointer-events-none">
    <div className="text-center">
      <div className="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-2">Live Stream</div>
      <div className="text-gray-500 text-sm">Game ID: {gameState.gameId || 'Waiting...'}</div>
      <div className="text-yellow-400 text-sm mt-4 animate-pulse">
        Waiting for game to start...
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{/* Game Status Overlay - Removed to keep video clean */}
```

## 🎯 Current Overlays (Still Visible)

These overlays remain because they're important for gameplay:

### **1. Circular Timer (Center)**
- Shows countdown during betting phase
- Shows emoji icons for other phases (🎴, ✓, ⏳)
- Essential for game timing

### **2. Round & Phase Indicator (Top Left)**
- Shows current round number
- Shows phase (Betting/Dealing/Complete)
- Shows remaining time during betting
- Essential for game status

### **3. Betting Locked (Center)**
- Shows "BETTING LOCKED" when betting period ends
- Only appears briefly
- Important user feedback

### **4. Winner Announcement (Center)**
- Shows "ANDAR WINS!" or "BAHAR WINS!"
- Shows winning card
- Only appears when game completes
- Essential game result

### **5. LIVE Badge (Top Left - from VideoStream)**
- Small red "LIVE" badge
- Only shows when game is active
- Minimal and unobtrusive

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before:**
- ❌ "Game ID" text covering video when idle
- ❌ "Waiting for game to start..." text
- ❌ "Live Stream" label
- ❌ Semi-transparent black overlay

### **After:**
- ✅ Clean video display when idle
- ✅ Only essential game overlays visible
- ✅ No unnecessary text
- ✅ Better viewing experience

## 🎮 Remaining Overlays Are Intentional

All remaining overlays serve specific gameplay purposes:
- **Timer** - Players need to know betting time
- **Round/Phase** - Players need to know game state
- **Betting Locked** - Important feedback
- **Winner** - Essential game result
- **LIVE Badge** - Minimal status indicator

    ...
  </div>
)}
```

### **Remove Round/Phase Indicator:**
