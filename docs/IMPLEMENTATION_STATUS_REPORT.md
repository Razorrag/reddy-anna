## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED TODAY

### **Critical Fix: WebSocket Message Integration**
**File:** `client/src/pages/player-game.tsx` (lines 358-391)

**Problem:** 
- Player page had comprehensive `handleWebSocketMessage()` function
- Function was never connected to WebSocketContext
- Messages were not being processed

**Solution:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = (window as any).gameWebSocket;
  
  if (ws) {
    const messageHandler = (event: MessageEvent) => {
      const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
      handleWebSocketMessage(message);
    };
    
    ws.addEventListener('message', messageHandler);
    
    return () => {
      ws.removeEventListener('message', messageHandler);
    };
  }
}, []);
```

**Impact:** ✅ All round transition messages now properly handled
