## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If server won't start:**
```bash
# Check JWT_SECRET
cat .env | grep JWT_SECRET

# Check logs
pm2 logs

# Common fixes:
# - Add JWT_SECRET to .env
# - Verify SUPABASE credentials
# - Check port not in use
```

- [ ] Checked logs
- [ ] Verified environment variables
- [ ] Issue resolved

### **If "Authentication required" errors:**
```bash
# Restart server
pm2 restart all

# Clear browser localStorage
# In browser console: localStorage.clear()
```

- [ ] Server restarted
- [ ] Browser data cleared
- [ ] Issue resolved

### **If CORS errors:**
```bash
# Edit .env
nano .env

# Add domain
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com

# Restart
pm2 restart all
```

- [ ] Domain added to ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [ ] Server restarted
- [ ] Issue resolved
