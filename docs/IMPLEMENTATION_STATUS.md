# Multi-Round Andar Bahar - Current Status

## ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & WORKING

### 1. Payout Logic (100% Correct)
**File**: `server/routes.ts` lines 160-187

```typescript
✅ Round 1:
   - Andar wins: 1:1 (stake × 2)
   - Bahar wins: 1:0 (refund only)

✅ Round 2:
   - Andar wins: ALL bets (R1+R2) × 2
   - Bahar wins: R1 × 2 + R2 × 1 (mixed)

✅ Round 3:
   - Both sides: Total invested (R1+R2) × 2
```

### 2. Auto Round Transitions
✅ Round 1 → Round 2 (2 second delay)
✅ Round 2 → Round 3 (2 second delay)
✅ Notifications sent to players
✅ Console logging for debugging

### 3. Timer System
✅ 30s betting timer for R1 and R2
✅ No timer for R3 (continuous draw)
✅ Server-authoritative timing
✅ WebSocket sync to all clients

### 4. Card Display
✅ Cards hidden during betting phase
✅ Cards revealed when timer = 0
✅ Cards appear in Andar/Bahar betting buttons
✅ Proper color coding (red/yellow for suits)

### 5. Admin Panel

✅ Round indicator (ROUND 1/2/3)
✅ Phase indicator (Betting/Dealing)

### 7. Database

✅ Bet tracking per user
✅ Card dealing records
✅ Game history
✅ WebSocket message types

## ⚠️ NEEDS MINOR ENHANCEMENT

### 1. Cumulative Bet Display
**Current**: Shows only total bets
**Needed**: Show R1 and R2 bets separately

**Player View Should Show**:
```
ANDAR
R1: ₹100,000
R2: ₹100,000
Total: ₹200,000
```

**Location**: `client/src/components/MobileGameLayout/BettingStrip.tsx`

### 2. Round 3 Admin UI
**Current**: Same card dealing interface
**Needed**: Clearer continuous draw UI

**Admin Panel Should Show**:
```
🔥 ROUND 3: CONTINUOUS DRAW
No more betting | No timer

[🎴 Deal to Bahar]  [🎴 Deal to Andar]

Current Count:
Bahar: 3 cards | Andar: 2 cards
```

**Location**: `client/src/components/AdminGamePanel/CardDealingPanel.tsx`

### 3. Payout Notifications
**Current**: Generic winner message
**Needed**: Detailed payout breakdown

**Player Should See**:
```
🎉 ANDAR WINS!

Your Payout:
Round 1 bet: ₹100K → ₹200K
Round 2 bet: ₹100K → ₹200K
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Return: ₹400,000
Profit: ₹200,000

New Balance: ₹5,400,000
```

**Location**: `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`

### 4. Balance Updates
**Current**: Balance tracked but not updated on payout
**Needed**: Real-time balance update via WebSocket

**Implementation**:
- Backend sends: `{ type: 'balance_update', data: { balance: 5400000 }}`
- Frontend updates: `playerBalance` state
