# Game Flow Fixes - Admin & Player Synchronization

## Summary
Fixed the complete game flow from admin card selection to player display, ensuring proper synchronization between admin and player interfaces.

## Changes Made

### 1. **OpeningCardSection.tsx** - Fixed Game Start Flow
- ‚úÖ Timer popup already exists and works correctly
- ‚úÖ Added proper WebSocket messages when starting Round 1:

  - `opening_card_confirmed` - Broadcasts opening card to all players
  - `timer_update` - Starts the betting countdown
- ‚úÖ Updates phase to 'betting' in context
- ‚úÖ Dispatches custom event to notify GameAdmin component about phase change
- ‚úÖ Opening card is properly selected and confirmed before game starts

**Flow:**
1. Admin selects opening card from 52-card grid
2. Selected card is highlighted and displayed
3. Admin clicks "Confirm & Display Opening Card" button
4. Timer popup appears asking for betting duration (10-300 seconds)
5. Admin clicks "Start Round 1" button
6. Timer starts counting down on both admin and player pages

### 3. **GameAdmin.tsx** - Fixed Phase Management
- ‚úÖ Added listener for phase changes from OpeningCardSection
