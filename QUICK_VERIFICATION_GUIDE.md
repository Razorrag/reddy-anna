# Quick Verification Guide

## üéØ How to Verify Data Flow is Working

### Option 1: Run Verification Script (Easiest)

```bash
# Make script executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/verify-data-flow.ts

# Run the script
npm run verify-data-flow
# OR
npx tsx scripts/verify-data-flow.ts
```

**What it checks:**
- ‚úÖ Game history is saved
- ‚úÖ Game statistics are saved  
- ‚úÖ Daily/Monthly/Yearly stats are calculated
- ‚úÖ Data transformation working
- ‚úÖ Values are not 0

---

### Option 2: Manual Database Check (Most Reliable)

```sql
-- 1. Check if ANY games exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_games FROM game_history;

-- 2. Check LATEST game with ALL details
SELECT 
  gh.game_id,
  gh.winner,
  gh.opening_card,
  gh.winning_card,
  gh.created_at,
  gs.total_bets,
  gs.andar_total_bet,
  gs.bahar_total_bet,
  gs.total_winnings,
  gs.total_players,
  gs.andar_bets_count,
  gs.bahar_bets_count
FROM game_history gh
LEFT JOIN game_statistics gs ON gh.game_id = gs.game_id
ORDER BY gh.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Check if BOTH tables are linked
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_history) as history_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_statistics) as stats_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_history gh 
   INNER JOIN game_statistics gs ON gh.game_id = gs.game_id) as linked_count;

-- 4. Check TODAY'S daily statistics
SELECT * FROM daily_game_statistics 
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Expected Results:**

If working correctly:
- `history_count` = `stats_count` = `linked_count` (all same number)
- Latest game has `total_bets > 0` if players placed bets
- Daily stats shows `total_games > 0` if games played today

If NOT working:
- `history_count > 0` but `stats_count = 0` ‚Üí Statistics not being saved
- `linked_count = 0` ‚Üí game_id mismatch between tables
- `total_bets = 0` even though bets were placed ‚Üí Data saving issue

---

### Option 3: Test Live Game (Complete Test)

**Step-by-step test:**

1. **Start a new game (Admin):**
   - Open `/admin/game`
   - Select opening card (e.g., 8‚ô†)
   - Click "Start Game"
   - ‚úÖ Check: Timer starts, opening card shows

2. **Place bets (Player):**
   - Open `/game` in another browser/incognito
   - Login as player
   - Place bet (e.g., ‚Çπ2500 on Andar)
   - ‚úÖ Check: Balance deducted, bet shows in admin panel

3. **Complete game (Admin):**
   - Deal cards until matching card appears
   - ‚úÖ Check: Winner announced, celebration shown

4. **Verify data saved:**
   ```sql
   -- Check latest game
   SELECT * FROM game_history 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   
   -- Check its statistics
   SELECT * FROM game_statistics 
   WHERE game_id = (
     SELECT game_id FROM game_history 
     ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
   );
   
   -- Check daily stats updated
   SELECT * FROM daily_game_statistics 
   WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;
   ```

5. **Verify frontend displays data:**
   - Admin: Open `/admin/analytics`
     - ‚úÖ Total Games should be > 0
     - ‚úÖ Total Bets should match bet amount
   - Anyone: Open game history page
     - ‚úÖ Latest game should appear
     - ‚úÖ Bet amounts should be correct

---

### Option 4: Check API Responses (For Developers)

```bash
# 1. Check game history API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/game/history?limit=5 | jq '.'

# Expected: Array of games with bet amounts
# Look for: andarTotalBet, baharTotalBet, totalBets

# 2. Check analytics API (requires admin token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/admin/analytics | jq '.daily'

# Expected: Object with totalGames, totalBets, etc.
# Look for: Non-zero values if games were played
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No game history found"
**Cause:** No games have been completed
**Solution:** Complete at least one game from start to finish

### Issue: "Games exist but total bets is 0"
**Causes:**
1. Game was completed without any bets placed
2. Admin dealt winning card immediately without letting players bet
3. Stats calculation issue

**Solution:**
- Make sure players place bets before completing game
- Check server logs for errors during game completion
- Verify `incrementDailyStats` is being called with correct values

### Issue: "History shows data but analytics shows 0"
**Causes:**
1. Data transformation not working (snake_case vs camelCase)
2. API returning wrong format
3. Frontend reading wrong field names

**Solution:**
1. Check API response format:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/analytics | jq '.daily'
   ```
2. Verify field names are camelCase: `totalGames` not `total_games`
3. Check browser console for data structure

### Issue: "Different numbers in database vs frontend"
**Causes:**
1. Cached data in frontend
2. WebSocket updates not received
3. Balance synchronization issue

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check WebSocket connection status
- Verify BalanceContext receiving updates

```sql
-- game_history
game_id: "abc-123-xyz"

## üöÄ Quick Test Command

Run all checks at once:

```bash
# Check database
psql $DATABASE_URL << EOF
\echo '\n=== Game History Count ==='
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_history;

\echo '\n=== Latest Game ==='
SELECT gh.game_id, gh.winner, gs.total_bets 
FROM game_history gh 
LEFT JOIN game_statistics gs ON gh.game_id = gs.game_id 
ORDER BY gh.created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

\echo '\n=== Today Stats ==='
SELECT total_games, total_bets, profit_loss 
FROM daily_game_statistics 
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;
EOF

# Check API
echo "\n=== API Game History ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/game/history?limit=1 | jq '.[0] | {gameId, winner, totalBets, andarTotalBet, baharTotalBet}'
```

Expected output shows non-zero values if games have been played.
