# Admin Login CSS Fix

## Issue
The admin login page CSS was broken due to global CSS rules in `player-game.css` affecting all pages.

## Root Cause

**File:** `client/src/player-game.css` (lines 30-45)

The player game CSS file had global styles applied to `html` and `body` tags:

```css
html, body {
  overflow: hidden;
  position: fixed; /* Prevent scrolling */
}
```

### Why This Broke Admin Login

1. **Global Scope:** These styles applied to **ALL pages**, not just the player game
2. **overflow: hidden** prevented scrolling on login pages
3. **position: fixed** broke the layout of centered login cards
4. **Result:** Admin login page appeared broken with no scrolling and misaligned elements

## Solution

Changed the CSS to only apply when the `.game-body` class is present:

**Before:**
```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: fixed;
}
```

**After:**
```css
/* Player game specific body styles - only apply when game-body class is present */
body:has(.game-body) {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: fixed;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### How It Works

- Uses CSS `:has()` pseudo-class selector
- Only applies styles when `body` contains an element with class `.game-body`
- Player game page has `<div class="game-body">` → styles apply ✅
- Admin login page has no `.game-body` → styles don't apply ✅
- Other pages unaffected ✅

## Files Modified

1. **`client/src/player-game.css`** (lines 30-43)
   - Changed global `html, body` selector to `body:has(.game-body)`
   - Scoped overflow and position styles to player game only

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Admin login page: No scrolling, broken layout
- ❌ Regular login page: No scrolling, broken layout
- ✅ Player game page: Working (but breaking other pages)

### After Fix
- ✅ Admin login page: Scrolling works, layout centered
- ✅ Regular login page: Scrolling works, layout centered
- ✅ Player game page: Still works, no scrolling (as intended)
- ✅ All other pages: Unaffected

## Browser Compatibility

The `:has()` selector is supported in:
- ✅ Chrome 105+
- ✅ Edge 105+
- ✅ Firefox 121+
- ✅ Safari 15.4+

**Note:** This covers 95%+ of modern browsers. For older browsers, the player game will still work, just without the fixed positioning.
