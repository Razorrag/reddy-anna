# WhatsApp Withdrawal & Deposit System - Complete Guide

## Overview
This system allows users to request withdrawals and deposits directly through WhatsApp. When a user fills out the form, it opens their WhatsApp app with a pre-filled message to the admin's WhatsApp number.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks the **WhatsApp floating button** (green button at bottom-right)
2. A modal opens with 4 options:
   - üí∞ **Withdrawal Request** - Withdraw money from account
   - üí≥ **Deposit Request** - Add money to account
   - üí¨ **Balance Inquiry** - Check current balance
   - ‚ùì **Support Request** - Get help with any issue

3. User selects an option and fills the form:
   - For Withdrawal/Deposit: Enter amount (minimum ‚Çπ100)
   - Add optional message
   - Click "Open WhatsApp"

4. **WhatsApp opens automatically** on user's device with:
   - Pre-filled message to admin
   - User's phone number
   - Request type and amount
   - Custom message (if provided)

5. User sends the message from their WhatsApp
6. Admin receives the message on their WhatsApp
7. Admin processes the request manually

## Configuration

### Admin WhatsApp Number

The admin WhatsApp number is stored in the database:

```sql
-- Default number
INSERT INTO game_settings (setting_key, setting_value, description)
VALUES ('admin_whatsapp_number', '918686886632', 'Admin WhatsApp number for user requests');

-- Update number
UPDATE game_settings 
SET setting_value = '919876543210' 
WHERE setting_key = 'admin_whatsapp_number';
```

**Via Admin Panel (when implemented):**
- Go to Game Settings
- Update "Admin WhatsApp Number"
- Save changes

## Database Tracking

All requests are logged in the `whatsapp_messages` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE whatsapp_messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(20),
    user_phone VARCHAR(15),
    admin_phone VARCHAR(15),
    request_type VARCHAR(50),      -- withdrawal, deposit, support, balance
    message TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20),             -- pending, sent, responded
    priority INTEGER,               -- 1-5 (1 = highest)
    is_urgent BOOLEAN,
    metadata TEXT,                  -- JSON string
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    responded_at TIMESTAMP,
    response_message TEXT,
    response_by VARCHAR(20)
);
```

**Purpose:**
