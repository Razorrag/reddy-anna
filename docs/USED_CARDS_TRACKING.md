# Used Cards Tracking & Visual Feedback

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive card tracking system to prevent admins from selecting the same card multiple times during a game session. Cards that have been used are visually disabled with animations and cannot be clicked again.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Global Card Tracking**
- Added `usedCards: Card[]` array to `GameStateContext`
- Automatically tracks all cards used throughout the game:
  - Opening card
  - Andar cards (all rounds)
  - Bahar cards (all rounds)
- Persists across rounds until game reset

### 2. **Visual Feedback for Used Cards**

#### **Disabled State**
- **Background**: Dark gray with reduced opacity (`bg-gray-800/50 opacity-40`)
- **Border**: Gray border (`border-2 border-gray-600`)
- **Text**: Grayed out (`text-gray-600`)
- **Cursor**: Not-allowed cursor (`cursor-not-allowed`)
- **Strike-through**: Diagonal red line across the card

#### **Selected State** (Active Selection)
- **Background**: Gold gradient (`from-gold to-yellow-500`)
- **Border**: White border with scale effect (`border-2 border-white scale-105`)
- **Shadow**: Glowing gold shadow (`shadow-lg shadow-gold/50`)
- **Animation**: Subtle pulse animation (2s infinite)
- **Text**: Black text for high contrast

#### **Available State** (Clickable)
- **Background**: Black with hover effect
- **Border**: Gold border that brightens on hover
- **Scale**: Slight scale-up on hover (`hover:scale-105`)
- **Text**: Red for hearts/diamonds, yellow for spades/clubs

### 3. **Visual Indicators**

#### **Red X Mark**
Used cards display a red "✗" symbol overlaid on the card face:
```tsx
{isUsed ? (
  <span className="relative">
    {card.display}
    <span className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-red-500 text-xs">✗</span>
  </span>
) : (
  card.display
)}
```

#### **Tooltip Messages**
- Used cards: "❌ Card already used in this game"
- Available cards: "{rank} of {suit}"
- Dealing in progress: "Dealing in progress"

### 4. **CSS Animations**

#### **Pulse Animation** (Selected Cards)
```css
@keyframes pulse-subtle {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.85; }
}

.animate-pulse-subtle {
  animation: pulse-subtle 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

#### **Strike-through Line** (Used Cards)
```css
.line-through::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 10%;
  right: 10%;
  height: 2px;
  background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.6);
  transform: translateY(-50%) rotate(-15deg);
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. **GameStateContext.tsx**
- Added `usedCards: Card[]` to state
- Added `ADD_USED_CARD` action type
- Modified `SET_OPENING_CARD`, `ADD_ANDAR_CARD`, `ADD_BAHAR_CARD` to auto-track used cards
- Added `addUsedCard()` function to context
- Clear `usedCards` on `RESET_GAME` and `CLEAR_CARDS`

### 2. **CardDealingPanel.tsx**
- Import `useGameState` hook
- Check `gameState.usedCards` for each card
- Apply disabled state and visual feedback
- Show red X mark on used cards
- Add CSS animations

### 3. **OpeningCardSelector.tsx**
- Check `gameState.usedCards` for each card
- Apply disabled state and visual feedback
- Show red X mark on used cards
- Add CSS animations

## Usage Flow

### Game Start
1. Admin selects opening card → Added to `usedCards`
2. Card becomes disabled with visual feedback

### Round 1 & 2
1. Admin selects Bahar card → Added to `usedCards`
2. Admin selects Andar card → Added to `usedCards`
3. Both cards become disabled with visual feedback
4. Admin clicks "Show Cards to Players"

### Round 3 (Continuous Draw)
1. Admin clicks cards one at a time
2. Each card is added to `usedCards` immediately
3. Card becomes disabled after selection

### Game Reset
1. Admin clicks "Start New Game"
2. `usedCards` array is cleared
3. All cards become available again

## Benefits

### For Admins
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Instantly see which cards have been used
- **Prevent Errors**: Cannot accidentally select the same card twice
- **Better UX**: Smooth animations and clear disabled states
- **Tooltips**: Helpful messages explain why cards are disabled

### For Game Integrity
- **Fair Play**: Ensures no card is dealt twice in a game
- **Consistency**: Tracks cards across all rounds
- **Reliability**: Automatic tracking prevents human error

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
interface GameState {
  usedCards: Card[];  // Tracks all used cards
  // ... other state
}

// Auto-tracking in reducers
case 'SET_OPENING_CARD':
  const isOpeningCardUsed = state.usedCards.some(c => c.id === action.payload.id);
  return { 
    ...state, 
    selectedOpeningCard: action.payload,
    usedCards: isOpeningCardUsed ? state.usedCards : [...state.usedCards, action.payload]
  };
```

### Component Logic
```typescript
const isUsed = gameState.usedCards.some(usedCard => usedCard.id === card.id);
const isDisabled = dealingInProgress || isUsed;

<button
  onClick={() => !isUsed && handleQuickCardSelect(card)}
  disabled={isDisabled}
  className={isUsed ? 'opacity-40 cursor-not-allowed line-through' : ''}
>
```
