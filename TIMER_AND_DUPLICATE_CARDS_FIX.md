# Timer & Duplicate Cards Fix

## Issues Found from Console Logs

### ❌ Issue 1: Unknown message type `cards_saved`
**Error**: `WebSocketContext.tsx:407 Unknown message type: cards_saved`

**Cause**: Frontend didn't have a handler for the `cards_saved` confirmation message from backend

**Fix**: Added `cards_saved` case handler in `WebSocketContext.tsx`

### ❌ Issue 2: Round 2 Timer Doesn't Start
**Problem**: Timer value is sent (30s) but countdown doesn't start on frontend

**Cause**: Missing `setBettingLocked(false)` when Round 2 starts

**Fix**: Added `setBettingLocked(false)` in `start_round_2` handler

### ❌ Issue 3: Duplicate Cards Dealt
**Problem**: Same cards (8♦ and J♦) dealt in both Round 1 and Round 2

**Cause**: Pre-selected cards from Round 1 weren't cleared before Round 2 started, so the backend auto-revealed the same cards again

**Fix**: 
1. Backend: Clear `preSelectedBaharCard` and `preSelectedAndarCard` in `transitionToRound2()`
2. Frontend: Clear `selectedBaharCard` and `selectedAndarCard` when round changes

---

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend - WebSocketContext.tsx

#### Added `cards_saved` Handler (Lines 411-415)
```typescript
case 'cards_saved':
  // Admin received confirmation that cards are saved
  console.log('✅ Cards saved confirmation:', data.data);
  showNotification(data.data.message || 'Cards saved successfully!', 'success');
  break;
```

#### Fixed Round 2 Timer (Lines 292-302)
```typescript
case 'start_round_2':
  console.log('🔄 Round 2 transition:', data.data);
  setCurrentRound(2);
  setPhase('betting');
  setBettingLocked(false); // ✅ ADDED - Unlock betting for Round 2
  if (data.data.timer) {
    setCountdown(data.data.timer);
    console.log('✅ Round 2 timer set to:', data.data.timer);
  }
  showNotification(data.data.message || 'Round 2 betting started!', 'success');
  break;
```

#### Fixed Round 3 Betting Lock (Lines 304-311)
```typescript
case 'start_final_draw':
  console.log('🔄 Round 3 transition:', data.data);
  setCurrentRound(3);
  setPhase('dealing');
  setBettingLocked(true); // ✅ ADDED - Lock betting for Round 3
  setCountdown(0);
  showNotification('Round 3: Final Draw! Admin will deal until match.', 'info');
  break;
```

### 2. Backend - routes.ts

#### Clear Pre-Selected Cards in Round 2 Transition (Lines 1352-1355)
```typescript
async function transitionToRound2() {
  console.log('Auto-transitioning to Round 2...');
  
  currentGameState.currentRound = 2;
  currentGameState.phase = 'betting';
  currentGameState.bettingLocked = false;
  
  // IMPORTANT: Clear pre-selected cards from Round 1
  currentGameState.preSelectedBaharCard = null;
  currentGameState.preSelectedAndarCard = null;
  console.log('✅ Cleared pre-selected cards for Round 2');
  
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### 3. Frontend - CardDealingPanel.tsx

#### Auto-Clear Selections on Round Change (Lines 26-37)
```typescript
const [previousRound, setPreviousRound] = useState(round);

// Clear selections when round changes
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (round !== previousRound) {
    console.log(`🔄 Round changed from ${previousRound} to ${round} - clearing card selections`);
    setSelectedBaharCard(null);
    setSelectedAndarCard(null);
    setDealingInProgress(false);
    setPreviousRound(round);
  }
}, [round, previousRound]);
```

## How It Works Now

### Round 1 → Round 2 Transition

**Before Fix**:
```
Round 1: Admin selects 8♦ (Bahar) + J♦ (Andar)
Round 1: Cards saved as preSelectedCards
Round 1: Timer expires → Cards auto-reveal
Round 1: No winner → Transition to Round 2
Round 2: preSelectedCards STILL SET (8♦ + J♦) ❌
Round 2: Timer expires → Same cards auto-reveal again ❌
Result: Duplicate cards dealt
```

**After Fix**:
```
Round 1: Admin selects 8♦ (Bahar) + J♦ (Andar)
Round 1: Cards saved as preSelectedCards
Round 1: Timer expires → Cards auto-reveal
Round 1: No winner → Transition to Round 2
Round 2: preSelectedCards CLEARED ✅
Round 2: Frontend selections CLEARED ✅
Round 2: Admin must select NEW cards ✅
Round 2: Timer expires → NEW cards auto-reveal ✅
Result: Different cards for each round
```

### Round 2 Timer

**Before Fix**:
```
Round 2 starts
→ bettingLocked stays TRUE from Round 1 ❌
→ Timer value set but countdown doesn't start ❌
→ Players can't place bets ❌
```

**After Fix**:
```
Round 2 starts
→ setBettingLocked(false) ✅
→ Timer value set AND countdown starts ✅
→ Players can place bets ✅
```
