## 🔄 GAME FLOW VERIFICATION

### Complete Game Cycle

```
1. IDLE PHASE
   ├─ Admin selects opening card
   ├─ Admin clicks "Start Round 1"
   └─ Backend: game_start message
   
2. ROUND 1 BETTING
   ├─ Backend broadcasts: opening_card_confirmed
   ├─ Frontend: Sets opening card, phase='betting', timer=30
   ├─ Timer counts down: 30→29→...→0
   ├─ Admin pre-selects cards (optional)
   └─ Timer expires → phase='dealing'
   
3. ROUND 1 DEALING
   ├─ Backend auto-reveals pre-selected cards OR
   ├─ Admin manually reveals cards
   ├─ Backend checks for winner
   ├─ If winner: completeGame()
   └─ If no winner: transitionToRound2()
   
4. ROUND 2 BETTING
   ├─ Backend broadcasts: start_round_2
   ├─ Frontend: round=2, phase='betting', timer=30
   ├─ Timer counts down
   ├─ Admin pre-selects cards
   └─ Timer expires → phase='dealing'
   
5. ROUND 2 DEALING
   ├─ Backend auto-reveals cards
   ├─ Backend checks for winner
   ├─ If winner: completeGame()
   └─ If no winner: transitionToRound3()
   
6. ROUND 3 CONTINUOUS DRAW
   ├─ Backend broadcasts: start_final_draw
   ├─ Frontend: round=3, phase='dealing', timer=0
   ├─ Admin deals cards one at a time
   ├─ Backend checks after each card
   └─ Winner found: completeGame()
   
7. GAME COMPLETE
   ├─ Backend broadcasts: game_complete
   ├─ Frontend shows: WinnerCelebration
   ├─ 5-second countdown
   ├─ Backend: Auto-restart (setTimeout 5s)

   └─ Back to step 1
```

## ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK

### 1. Race Conditions
**Area**: Timer expiry and card dealing
**Risk**: Cards might be dealt before timer fully expires
**Check**: Ensure proper sequencing in `startTimer()` callback

### 2. State Synchronization
**Area**: Frontend-backend state mismatch
**Risk**: Frontend shows different state than backend
**Check**: Verify all broadcast messages update frontend correctly

### 3. Card Clearing on Reset
**Area**: `game_reset` handler
**Risk**: Cards might not clear properly
**Check**: Verify `clearCards()` clears opening card, andar cards, bahar cards

### 4. Pre-Selected Cards Persistence
**Area**: Round transitions
**Risk**: Pre-selected cards from R1 might persist to R2
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (lines 1352-1355 in routes.ts)

### 5. Betting Lock State
**Area**: Round transitions
**Risk**: Betting might not unlock/lock properly
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (added setBettingLocked calls)

### 6. Timer State
**Area**: Round transitions
**Risk**: Timer might not reset properly
**Check**: Verify timer resets to 30 in R2, 0 in R3
