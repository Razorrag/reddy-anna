## 📊 Betting Analytics Example

```
💰 Live Betting Analytics - Round 1

🎴 ANDAR                           🎴 BAHAR
₹1,50,000                          ₹2,30,000
[██████████████░] 39.5%           [████████████████████] 60.5%
↓ ₹80,000 behind Bahar            ↑ ₹80,000 ahead

💎 Total Betting Pool: ₹3,80,000

⚠️ Unbalanced Betting Detected
Andar has significantly fewer bets. House risk is 21.1% imbalanced.
```

## 🎴 Card Dealing Workflow

```
1. Select Bahar Card (e.g., 7♦)
   └─> Highlighted in gold
   
2. Select Andar Card (e.g., K♠)
   └─> Both cards shown in preview
   
3. Click "Deal Cards"
   └─> Bahar card dealt immediately
   └─> Andar card dealt after 800ms
   └─> Backend checks for winner
   └─> Players see cards instantly via WebSocket
```

## 🔄 Round Progression

```
ROUND 1 → 30s betting → Deal 2 cards → Check winner
   ↓ (No winner)
ROUND 2 → 30s betting → Deal 2 more cards → Check winner
   ↓ (No winner)
ROUND 3 → No betting → Continuous dealing → First match wins
```
