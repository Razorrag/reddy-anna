### Step 3: Configure A Record for Root Domain

1. In the **DNS Records** section, look for existing **A records**
2. Find the A record for `@` or `raajugarikossu.com` (root domain)
3. Click the **‚ãÆ** (three dots) next to it ‚Üí **Edit**
   - **OR** if it doesn't exist, click **Add** ‚Üí **A**

4. **Configure the A record:**
   - **Type**: A (should already be selected)
   - **Name/Host**: `@` (or leave blank, or `raajugarikossu.com`)
     - `@` represents the root domain (raajugarikossu.com)
   - **Value/Points to**: `91.108.110.72` (your VPS IP)

   - If you see CNAME for `@` or `www`, **delete it** or change it

2. **Check for other A records**:
   - Make sure there are no other A records pointing to different IPs
   - Update or remove any conflicting records

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Verify DNS Configuration

### Wait 5-10 Minutes

**DNS changes can take 5-10 minutes to propagate** (sometimes up to 48 hours, but usually much faster)

### Verify DNS is Working

Run these commands on your server or locally:

```bash
# Check if DNS points to your VPS IP
dig raajugarikossu.com +short

# Should return: 91.108.110.72

# Check www subdomain too
dig www.raajugarikossu.com +short

# Should also return: 91.108.110.72
```

**OR** use online tools:
- Go to **https://dnschecker.org**
- Enter: `raajugarikossu.com`
- Check if it shows: `91.108.110.72`

**Keep checking until you see `91.108.110.72`**

## üîç What Your DNS Records Should Look Like

### In GoDaddy DNS Manager, you should have:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 91.108.110.72 | 600 |
| A | www | 91.108.110.72 | 600 |

### You might also have (these are fine to keep):
- **NS** records (name servers) - Don't change these
- **SOA** record - Don't change this
- **MX** records (for email) - Keep if you need email
- **TXT** records (for verification/SPF) - Keep if needed

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "I can't find the DNS button"

**Solution:**
- Go to **My Products** ‚Üí **Domains**
- Click **Manage** next to your domain

Once DNS is pointing to `91.108.110.72`, continue with the **SSL Certificate Setup**:

   sudo apt install certbot -y
   ```

2. **Stop services using port 80**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop nginx
   sudo systemctl stop apache2
   pm2 stop andar-bahar
   ```

3. **Get SSL Certificate**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d raajugarikossu.com -d www.raajugarikossu.com
   ```

4. **Copy certificates** to your app directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/andar-bahar/app
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/raajugarikossu.com/privkey.pem ./server.key
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/raajugarikossu.com/fullchain.pem ./server.crt
   sudo chown $USER:$USER server.key server.crt
   chmod 600 server.key
   chmod 644 server.crt
   ```

5. **Update .env file**:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   HTTPS_ENABLED=true
   SSL_KEY_PATH=./server.key
   SSL_CERT_PATH=./server.crt
   ```

6. **Restart your app**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart andar-bahar
   ```
