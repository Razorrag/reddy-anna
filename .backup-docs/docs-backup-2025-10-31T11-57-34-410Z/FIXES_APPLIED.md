- Current: Graceful redirect to login

### Mobile Optimization
- UI responsive but could be improved
- Solution: Test on various devices and adjust CSS

## 📝 MAINTENANCE NOTES

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check server logs
pm2 logs

# Check WebSocket connections
# Look for: "🔌 Client authenticated"

# Check balance updates
# Look for: "✅ Balance updated atomically"

# Check card dealing
# Look for: "🎴 ✅ Valid card dealing"
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: WebSocket disconnects frequently  
**Solution**: Check CORS settings and SSL configuration

**Issue**: Balance not updating  
**Solution**: Verify `update_balance_atomic` function exists in database

**Issue**: Cards dealing in wrong order  
**Solution**: Check admin is following error messages (Bahar first)

**Issue**: Payouts incorrect  
**Solution**: Verify `calculatePayout` function logic matches requirements
