## 🔄 Why Both Routes?

Having multiple routes pointing to the same functionality provides:

1. **Flexibility**: Different admins can use their preferred URL
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing bookmarks still work
3. **Consistency**: Same experience regardless of entry point
4. **Simplicity**: One component to maintain

---

## 🎨 Implementation

### admin.tsx
```typescript
import AdminGamePanel from '@/components/AdminGamePanel/AdminGamePanel';

export default function Admin() {
  return <AdminGamePanel />;
}
```

### admin-game.tsx
```typescript
import AdminGamePanel from '@/components/AdminGamePanel/AdminGamePanel';

export default function AdminGame() {
  return <AdminGamePanel />;
}
```

**Both files render the same component!**
