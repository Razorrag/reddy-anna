# 🔍 Check DNS Status Now

## ✅ What We Know

Your system doesn't have:
- ❌ `systemd-resolve` (old command)
- ❌ `nscd` service

**But that's OK!** Local DNS cache doesn't affect Let's Encrypt verification anyway.

---

## 🎯 What Matters: Global DNS Propagation

**Let's Encrypt checks DNS from their servers, not your local cache.**

So we need to check what **public DNS servers** see:

---

## 📊 Step 1: Check DNS from Public DNS Servers

**Run these commands on your server:**

```bash
# Check what Google DNS sees (most important - Let's Encrypt often uses Google DNS)
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @8.8.8.8

# Check what Cloudflare DNS sees
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @1.1.1.1

# Check what Quad9 DNS sees
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @9.9.9.9

# Compare with your default DNS
dig raajugarikossu.com +short
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ If they show **ONLY** `91.108.110.72` → DNS is correct! Try certbot now.
- ⏳ If they show **multiple IPs** → Still propagating, wait 15-30 minutes
- ❌ If they show **wrong IPs only** → GoDaddy DNS might not be fixed yet

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Check DNS Online

**This shows DNS status from multiple global locations:**

1. **Go to**: https://dnschecker.org
2. **Enter**: `raajugarikossu.com`
3. **Click**: Search
4. **Check results** from different locations:
   - Some locations might show only `91.108.110.72` (updated)
   - Some might still show multiple IPs (not updated yet)

**This tells you if DNS is propagating globally.**

---

## ⏰ Step 3: How Long to Wait

**DNS propagation timeline:**

- **Just changed DNS in GoDaddy**: Wait at least **15-30 minutes**
- **Changed more than 30 minutes ago**: Should be mostly propagated
- **Changed more than 2 hours ago**: Should be fully propagated

**If you just changed DNS:**
- Wait **15-30 minutes**
- Check again from public DNS servers
- Try certbot once DNS shows only `91.108.110.72`

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Try Certbot When DNS is Ready

**Once DNS shows ONLY `91.108.110.72` from most public DNS servers:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure port 80 is free
sudo lsof -i :80
# Should return nothing (empty)

# 2. Stop services using port 80
sudo systemctl stop nginx
pm2 stop andar-bahar

# 3. Verify port 80 is free
sudo lsof -i :80
# Should still be empty

# 4. Get certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d raajugarikossu.com -d www.raajugarikossu.com
```

---

## 🚨 If Certbot Still Fails

**If certbot still says it's checking wrong IP (like `13.248.243.5`):**

1. **Double-check GoDaddy DNS:**
   - Make absolutely sure only ONE A record exists
   - Take a screenshot of DNS records
   - Verify you saved changes

2. **Check DNS from Let's Encrypt's perspective:**
   - Go to https://dnschecker.org
   - Enter `raajugarikossu.com`
   - Check if results show multiple IPs

3. **Wait longer:**
   - DNS can take up to 48 hours (rare)
   - But usually 15-30 minutes is enough

4. **Alternative: Lower TTL in GoDaddy:**
   - Edit A record
   - Change TTL to `600` seconds (10 minutes)
   - Save changes
   - Wait another 10-15 minutes

---

## ⚡ Quick Commands to Run Right Now

```bash
# Check DNS from Google DNS (what Let's Encrypt likely sees)
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @8.8.8.8

# Check DNS from Cloudflare DNS
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @1.1.1.1

# Check www subdomain from Google DNS
dig www.raajugarikossu.com +short @8.8.8.8
```

**Share the results!**

- If they show **only `91.108.110.72`** → DNS is ready! ✅
- If they show **multiple IPs** → Still propagating, wait 15-30 min ⏰
- If they show **wrong IPs only** → GoDaddy DNS needs fixing ❌

---

## 📋 Next Steps Checklist

- [ ] Checked DNS from `@8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
- [ ] Checked DNS from `@1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare DNS)
- [ ] Checked DNS online at https://dnschecker.org
- [ ] Verified GoDaddy has only ONE A record for `@` → `91.108.110.72`
- [ ] Waited 15-30 minutes since DNS change
- [ ] DNS shows ONLY `91.108.110.72` from most sources
- [ ] Tried certbot again

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

**You're ready for certbot when:**

```bash
dig raajugarikossu.com +short @8.8.8.8
91.108.110.72
```

**Only ONE IP address!** ✅

Then certbot will work! 🎉
