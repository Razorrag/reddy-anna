# Authentication Frontend-Backend Binding Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Admin Login Critical Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling `/api/auth/login` instead of `/api/auth/admin/login`
- Frontend was sending `{ username, password }` but backend expected `{ email, password }`
- Frontend was doing manual admin role checking instead of trusting backend

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed endpoint to `/api/auth/admin/login`
- Updated request payload to send `email` (generated from username)
- Removed manual admin role checking
- Updated response handling to use `response.admin` data structure

### 2. User Login Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling `/auth/login` instead of `/api/auth/login`
- Response structure mismatch between frontend expectation and backend response

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed endpoint to `/api/auth/login`
- Updated response handling to use `response.user` data structure
- Maintained email generation from username logic

### 3. Signup Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling `/auth/register` instead of `/api/auth/register`
- Frontend was sending `{ username, email, password }` but backend expected different structure
- Missing required fields like `name` and `mobile`

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed endpoint to `/api/auth/register`
- Updated request payload to include `name`, `email`, `password`, `mobile`
- Updated response handling to use `response.user` data structure

## Current Authentication Flow

### User Registration
```
Frontend: POST /api/auth/register
Payload: { name, email, password, mobile }
Backend: registerUser() → storage.createUser() → JWT token
Response: { success: true, user: { id, username, balance }, token }
```

### User Login
```
Frontend: POST /api/auth/login  
Payload: { email, password }
Backend: loginUser() → storage.getUserByUsername() → validatePassword() → JWT token
Response: { success: true, user: { id, username, balance }, token }
```

### Admin Login
```
Frontend: POST /api/auth/admin/login
Payload: { email, password }
Backend: loginAdmin() → storage.getUserByUsername() → validatePassword() → JWT token
Response: { success: true, admin: { id, username, balance }, token }
```

## Backend Endpoint Structure

All authentication endpoints now follow consistent structure:

1. **POST /api/auth/register** - User registration
2. **POST /api/auth/login** - User login  
3. **POST /api/auth/admin/login** - Admin login

All endpoints:
-Expect `{ email, password }` for login operations
- Return `{ success: boolean, user/admin: object, token: string, error?: string }`
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Store user data in Supabase with proper password hashing

## Frontend Request/Response Handling

All frontend auth pages now:
- Use correct `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- Send properly formatted request payloads
- Handle response data structure correctly (`response.user` or `response.admin`)
- Store user data in localStorage for WebSocket authentication
- Set appropriate user roles (`player` or `admin`)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test User Registration:**
   - Create new user via signup form
   - Verify user is created in Supabase
   - Check password is properly hashed

2. **Test User Login:**
   - Login with created user credentials
   - Verify JWT token is generated
   - Check user data is stored in localStorage

3. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Login with admin credentials (admin@example.com / Admin123456)
   - Verify admin role is assigned
   - Check admin dashboard access

4. **Test WebSocket Authentication:**
   - Verify WebSocket connections use stored user data
   - Check role-based access control in WebSocket messages

## Security Notes

- Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens include user ID, username, and role
- Admin role verification is done on backend, not frontend
- Rate limiting is applied to auth endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization is implemented

## Database Schema Alignment

The fixes ensure frontend requests align with the Supabase database schema:
- Users table: id, username, password_hash, email, role, balance, etc.
- Admin users have role = 'admin'
- Regular users have role = 'player'
- All passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes
