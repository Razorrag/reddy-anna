# Control Buttons Equal Width Fix

## Overview
Fixed the 4 control buttons (History, Undo, Chip Selector, Rebet) to have equal widths with no spacing between them.

## Problem
- Buttons had different widths (History/Undo/Rebet were `w-11`, Chip button was `flex-1 max-w-28`)
- There was a `gap-2` (0.5rem/8px) between buttons creating unwanted spacing
- Inconsistent button sizing made the UI look unbalanced

## Solution
Applied `flex-1` to all 4 buttons to distribute available space equally, and removed the `gap-2` class.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
`client/src/components/MobileGameLayout/ControlsRow.tsx`

### Specific Changes

**1. Container Div**
```tsx
// BEFORE
<div className={`flex items-center justify-between gap-2 ${className}`}>

// AFTER
<div className={`flex items-center ${className}`}>
```
- Removed `justify-between` (not needed with flex-1)
- Removed `gap-2` (eliminates spacing between buttons)

**2. All Button Classes**
```tsx
// BEFORE
className="w-11 h-11 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg ..."  // History, Undo, Rebet
className="flex-1 max-w-28 h-11 bg-gradient-to-r ..."  // Chip Selector

// AFTER
className="flex-1 h-11 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg ..."  // All buttons
```
- Changed `w-11` to `flex-1` for History, Undo, and Rebet buttons
- Removed `max-w-28` from Chip Selector button
- All buttons now use `flex-1` for equal width distribution

## Visual Result

## Technical Details

### Flexbox Layout
- **Container:** `display: flex` with `items-center`
- **All Buttons:** `flex: 1` (equal flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis)
- **Height:** Fixed at `h-11` (44px) for all buttons
- **No Gaps:** Buttons are adjacent with no spacing

### Button Distribution
With `flex-1` on all 4 buttons:
- Each button gets exactly 25% of the container width
- Buttons automatically resize based on screen width
- No fixed pixel widths (except height)
- Perfectly aligned edges

## Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency:** All buttons have equal importance and space
2. **No Spacing Issues:** Seamless button row with no gaps
3. **Responsive:** Buttons scale proportionally on all screen sizes
4. **Cleaner UI:** More professional and polished appearance
5. **Better Touch Targets:** Larger buttons are easier to tap on mobile
